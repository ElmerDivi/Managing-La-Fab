Hey there !

This repository contains everything related to a popular football tournament  
organised in JECRC Foundation, Jaipur, that took place in March 2019.

## About the tournament

Inspired by Real Madrid's youth academy  
and a similar goal to _find players_ among the youth (and unnoticed),  
La Fabrica is a tournament hosted by JECRC's players.

Brainchild of Kamal Singh Saroha (passing batch 2018),  
the tournament has had _four_ seasons so far with two different formats ,  
_Home Edition_ (only for students of JECRC) and _All-Stars Edition_ (players from all over).
