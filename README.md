## About the tournament

Inspired by the idea of youth academy  
and a similar goal to _find players_ among the youth (and unnoticed),  
La Fabrica (La Masia was already taken :p) is a tournament  
hosted by football players of JECRC Foundation, Jaipur.

Brainchild of Kamal Singh Saroha (passing batch 2018),  
the tournament has had _four seasons_ so far with two different formats ,  
_Home Edition_ (only for students of JECRC) and _All-Stars Edition_ (players from all over).
